        ### Requirements

        ```
        
        ### Installation
        
        **Note:** This package is well tested on `django>=2.0`. But if you are using older versions can be
        used with minor changes in structure.
        
        install using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install django-bigbluebutton
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        Register app in `settings.py`
        
        ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            "django_bigbluebutton",
        ]
        ```
        
        Now should define you Big Blue Button Server core configs in `settings.py`:
        
        ```python
        BBB_API_URL = 'https://test.com/bigbluebutton/api/'
        BBB_SECRET_KEY = 'abcdefgabcdefgabcdefgabcdefgabcdefg'
        ```
        
        Next apply migrations:
        ```bash
        python manage.py migrate
        ```
        
        And finally run test:
        
        ```bash
        python manage.py test
        ```
        
        You can follow `tests.py` file to see how to use this package.
        
        ### Admin Integration
        
        By installing this app in your django project, A admin section will be added named `Meeting`.
        Under this section you can see list of open meetings, join meeting, create join link for other
        users with moderator or attendee permissions.
        
        Also to enable update state of each meeting (sync with bigbluebutton) set below variable in 
        `settings.py`:
        
        ```python
        UPDATE_RUNNING_ON_EACH_CALL = True
        ```
        
        So whenever you open list of meetings in django admin, it will update state of all meetings in database
        with result of `getMeetings` API from bigbluebutton.
